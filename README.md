# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project completed as part of the exercises from the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* (Chapter 2).

## Project Overview

The project is a practical implementation and demonstration of concepts covered in the book's Chapter 2, focusing on building a machine learning model using Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow. It covers essential steps in a typical machine learning pipeline, including:

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Model deployment and prediction

## Repository Contents

- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts containing the code for the project.
- **Datasets:** Data files or references to datasets used in the project.
- **Documentation:** Additional documentation, reports, or explanations related to the project.

## Usage
